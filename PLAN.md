# A) TERRAIN
	1. Create base terrain map via fractal perlin noise (mild)
	2. Generate tectonic plates via Weighted Probabilistic Flood Fill algoirthm  
	3. Assign each tectonic plate a type: continental / oceanic
	4. Assign motion vectors and density for each tectonic plate
	5. Initialize a neutral custom region_map for each special landform type (tectonic bias, mountain range, volcanic arc, trench, rift, etc. maps) (def: False)
	6. Initialize a neutral custom mask_noise map for each special landform type (def: 0)
	7. Create base/reference noise maps for each landform type
	8. Iterate over each cell in the map
	
	9. For each non-boundary cell:
		I. Apply Initial tectonic type-based elevation bias in the dedicated mask 
		
	10. For each boundary cell:
		I. Mark region cells based on interaction type in the appropriate region_map
		II. Convergent:
				- Continental-Continental: Centered "normal" mountain range
				- Continental-Oceanic: Centered trench + volcanic mountain arc, parallel to boundary, offset into the continental plate
				- Oceanic-Oceanic: Centered trench + volcanic mountain arc, parallel to boundary, offset into the least dense plate of the two
			Divergent: 
				- Continental-Continental: Centered rifts
				- Continental-Oceanic: (SKIP)
				- Oceanic-Oceanic: Centered ridge
		III. In order to define an entire special region, for each boundary cell mark neighboring pixels for width
		
	11. For each cell in each region_map:
		I. Reference noise value for current cell by type, assign the value in mask_noise
	
	12. Smoothen all mask noises using box blur, appropriate blur strength individually
	13. Add all mask noises map over the terrain, combine them and re-normalize
	14. Set sea-level dynamically
	
	
# B) TEMPERATURE
	1. Generate cosinusoidal, latitudal base temperature map (polars cold, equator hot)
	2. Reduce temperature based on elevation and lapse_rate ( ~6.5Â°C per 1000 meters )
	3. Add noise
	
	
# C) Precipitation (by iterative moisture simulation)
	1. Generate moisture map:
		I. Moist above ocean (elevation < sea_level)
		II. Add noise
		
	2. Generate prevailing winds vector field + coriolis + variation
	3. Run iterative moisture simulation (for each cell + Sliding Window algorithm):
		I. 	Compute saturation threshold based on average local elevation (higher elevation = lower capacity) and temperature (lower temperature = lower capacity) of all neighbors
		II. If moisture > saturation, convert excess moisture into precipitation by release_factor
		III. Move the moisture based on the prevailing winds vector field
		IV. Retain some portion of the moisture in the current location, move the rest into the next position
		V. Slide averaging window
	
	
# D) Biome classification
	1. Determine the biome at each cell based on the biome map via the 3 factors ( Elevation, Temperature, Precipitation )
