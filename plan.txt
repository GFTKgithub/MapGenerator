A) TERRAIN
	1. Tectonic plates via worley noise
	2. Assign tectonic plates type, continental or oceanic
	3. Initial tectonic-type elevation bias
	4. Assing direction for each tectonic plate
	5. For each plate boundary:
		Convergent:
			- Continental-Continental: Centered "normal" mountain range
			- Continental-Oceanic: Centered trench + volcanic mountain arc, parallel to boundary, offset 100-300km into the continental plate
			- Oceanic-Oceanic: Centered trench + volcanic mountain arc, parallel to boundary, offset 100-300km into random plate of the two
		Divergent: 
			-Continental-Continental: Centered rifts
			-Continental-Oceanic: SKIP
			-Oceanic-Oceanic: Centered ridge	
	6. Apply fractal noise (not too strong)
	
	
	
B) TEMPERATURE
	1. Generate cosinusoidal, latitude-based base temperature map (polars cold, equator hot)
	2. Reduce temperature based on elevation and lapse_rate ( ~6.5Â°C per 1000 meters )
	3. Add noise
	
	
	
C) Pericipitation (by iterative moisture simulation)
	1. Generate moisture map:
		- Moist above water
		- Add noise
	2. Generate prevailing winds vector field
	3. Run iterative moisture simulation (for each point):
		I. 	Solve for a saturation threshold based on orographic lift (positive slope = lower saturation) and local temperature (lower temperature = lower saturation)
		II. If moisture > saturation, deduct moisture into percipitation by releaseFactor
		III. Move the moisture based on the prevailing winds
		IV. Retain some portion of the moisture in the current location, move the rest into the next position
	
	
	
D) Biome classification
	1. Determine the biome at each point based on the biome map via the 3 factors ( Elevation, Temperature, Percipiation )
